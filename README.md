# Matlab compiler for python

[Matlab](https://se.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) is the number
one choice for many researchers within the scientific computing
community. There many reasons for this, for example the fact that
Matlab is a commercial software provides confidence that the core
functionality is robust and contains few bugs. 

Today we see a shift on the software side towards open source
alternatives such as [python](https://www.python.org). So can we take
out old, robust Matlab code and integrate that into our new python
library? Yes we can! And, it is possible to run that code without
buying an expensive a Matlab license? Yes, that is possible!
In this repo I will show you how.
